# Bong

Bong is a simple 2D table tennis game demonstrating basic capabilities of Blinkblind and SDL3.

## Project Scope

Project is currently under development. Our plan for Bong is;

1. Separating general functions into Blinkblind
2. Creating a full game with intro, menu and options.
3. We might include customization, game saves and replay abilities depending on the situation.
